# This is an example item name translation file.
# Add replacements line per line, separating original and replacement with a =
# For example, the following replaces Pine log with Spruce log :
Pine Log=Spruce Log
# meaning - when the sign says Pine Log, you can search for Spruce Log to find it
# Lines that start with a # are considered comments and ignored
# You can use java regular expressions, as in 
#(.*) horse armor=\1 barding
# to replace horse armor with barding and keep the gold, iron, or diamond in front of it.
# or replace abbreviations of shulker with shulker, ignoring case:
#(?i)sh[a-z]*r=shulker
# (You must remove the comments for those to work)
